# proc-gen-sandbox
A repository of game- &amp; audio-centric procedural generation experimentation. This repo will hopefully end up containing a lot of the necessary proc gen code needed for a tentative game project of mine.

Things to keep in mind if you decide to watch / star this repo:
* It's obviously empty right now! My tentative plan is to start these experiments in late May 2017.
* The current plan is to use [RogueSharp](https://bitbucket.org/FaronBracy/roguesharp) paired with [SadConsole](https://github.com/Thraka/SadConsole). I work on a Windows machine but SadConsole should also work on a Linux box and possibly Mac OSes as well.
